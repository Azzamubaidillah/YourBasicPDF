# YourBasicPDF 📄✨

**Because you just want to read the damn file.**

Welcome to **YourBasicPDF**, the macOS PDF editor that doesn't ask for your credit card, doesn't try to sell you a cloud subscription, and definitely doesn't want to be your "AI-powered document assistant."

It opens PDFs. It saves PDFs. It lets you delete that one page you messed up. That's it. That's the pitch.

## Features (The "Basic" Pack)

*   **Open & Read**: Look at your documents with your own two eyes.
*   **Search**: Find words. We use high-tech "string matching" technology.
*   **Undo/Redo**: Because we all make mistakes.
*   **Save As**: Keep the original, ruin the copy.
*   **Copy/Paste Pages**: Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V. Groundbreaking stuff.
*   **Zoom**: Make it big. Make it small.
*   **Dark Mode**: For when you're working at 3 AM and questioning your life choices.

## Installation
